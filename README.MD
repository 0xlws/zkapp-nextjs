# Zkapp UI for Next.js

This project is a Next.js-based user interface for interacting with zero-knowledge applications. It builds upon the foundational work done in the following repositories:

- Original UI components inspired by [zkapp-ui](https://github.com/RaidasGrisk/zkapp-ui)
- Integration with the O(1) Labs JavaScript API inspired by [zkapp-o1js](https://github.com/RaidasGrisk/zkapp-o1js)

Both of the original repositories were initially Vue.js implementations that have been adapted and re-envisioned within a Next.js framework.

## Getting Started

To get started with this Next.js implementation of Zkapp UI, follow these setup instructions.

### Installation

1. Clone the Zkapp UI Next.js repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/0xlws/zkapp-nextjs.git
```

2. Navigate to the repository directory, into the `ui` directory where the UI component code resides::

```bash
cd zkapp-nextjs/cd
```

3. Install the required dependencies:

```bash
yarn install
```

### Running the Development Server

To start the development server, run the following command:

```bash
yarn dev
```

This will start the server, typically available at `http://localhost:3000` or another port if specified.

## Usage

After starting the development server, you can open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:3000` to view the UI.
