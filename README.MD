## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple example steps.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone <REPOSITORY_URL>
```

Replace `<REPOSITORY_URL>` with the URL of the Git repository you want to clone.

2. Navigate into the repository's directory:

```bash
cd <REPOSITORY_NAME>
```

Replace `<REPOSITORY_NAME>` with the name of the repository you just cloned.

3. Navigate into the `ui` directory where the UI component code resides:

```bash
cd ui
```

4. Install the required dependencies:

```bash
yarn install
```

### Running the Development Server

To start the development server, run the following command:

```bash
yarn dev
```

This will start the server, typically available at `http://localhost:3000` or another port if specified.

## Usage

After starting the development server, you can open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:3000` to view the UI.
